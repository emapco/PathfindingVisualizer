# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer
PyQt5 desktop app that visualizes breath-first-search, Dijkstra, and A* pathfinding algorithms.

User Instructions:
  * Start by running main module.
  * Add barrier blocks to grid with mouse click/drag
  * Add forest blocks with mouse click/drag and Shift (Mouse + SHIFT)
  * Add desert blocks with mouse click/drag and Alt (Mouse + ALT)
  * Remove barrier/terrain blocks from grid using mouse click/drag and control (Mouse + CTRL)
  * Change start point, end point, and algorithm in the parameters popup (Click 'change parameters' button)
  * Clear the grid except the start and end points by clicking 'clear grid' button
  * Clear previous path by clicking 'clear path' button
  * Visualize the algorithm by clicking the 'Start animation' button
  
 Planned changes:
  * Allow user to specify forest (weight=2) and desert (weight=3) block weight values in parameters window.
